# Backend Test.

## Project Architecture.
The backend is in node.js 10.16.3 and graphql.
The Database is in mongodb 4.2.

I chose Mongodb because it's a nosql database scalable and it's useful with javascript. MongoDB stores documents and with that we can store all the data without make any transformations. We use GraphQL because it's a great alternative for API.


## RUN PROJECT
You can run the project with npm start
